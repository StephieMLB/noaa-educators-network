# Behavior Change Book Club

## Description
This book club provides NOAA Educators with a practical introduction to the strategies, methods, and tools of environmental communication that effectively lead to changes in behavior, primarily using social marketing. The knowledge gained through the book club's readings, presentations and discussions will benefit all practicing outreach and education professionals faced with the challenge of changing behaviors.

Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts plus a final project. We’ve selected the free online book, [Fostering Sustainable Behaviors][1]. It will be entirely online, in a distance learning format, with both asynchronous and synchronous portions.

## Details
The book club activities will take about 6 to 8 hours a month.  Time will include:
- **Reading the Chapters**: selected for each module. We’ll go through a module every two weeks starting in April, so the book club will run for about three months.
- **Presentations**: Summaries of each section with examples from NOAA programs. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. 
- **Group Discussions**: Join conference calls to discuss ideas from the module with your peers.
- **Final Project**: A practical application of lessons from the book, translating what you learned into a usable strategy for yourself and your program. The project must address a real problem and real barriers and be able to be implemented within the reasonable set of resources of the players for whom you propose the strategy. The project can be plan for activities in the future or a case study of a project that has already occurred.
- **Participation**: One of the most critical elements of the book club will be your personal contribution to the course through consistent postings to listserv, as well as participation during conference call discussions.

## Policies
- There is no requirement to participate or complete all activities. You can start and finish on your own.
- Conference Calls: Every effort is made to be accomodate to all timezones. We realize not everyone can jump on a call in the afternoon. We encourage the development of local calls with people in your region. 
- Cost: Free. 
- Feel free to reuse and repackage the materials for your own needs.
