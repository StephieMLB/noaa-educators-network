Welcome to the NOAA Citizen Science Community of Practice!  Please take a minute or two to introduce yourself.  You may want to share:
a) your name (and email address);
b) which part of NOAA you work for;
c) what your involvement or interest in citizen science entails; 
d) what you hope to get out participating in this community; and
e) what expertise or materials you have that you might be willing to share

Maybe replace one of the questions, with ideas or requests for collaboration?

That is far and away the most popular thread in our discussion forum.  How would structure the sharing of people's responses?   Would it be via a discussion forum, listserve, or other mechanism?  It might be nice to more neatly compile responses

A couple overall thoughts/questions:
1) I might suggest changing question c) to a more general question about what their main focus is in working with education.
2) Would there be an interest in having them share what percent of their time they spend on supporting education activities?
