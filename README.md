# Request to Volunteer

Thank you for your support and participation in the NOAA Educators Network. We're still in the early stages and now we're ready to try something new and wanted to see if this is something you might be interested in.

As part of the next phase of the NOAA Educators Network webinar series, we're working on a series about Fostering Behavior Change. I was wondering if this is a topic relevant to your work and whether you might be interested in volunteering to be a part of this. Here's a summary of the idea so far: 

In a nutshell: Capacity-building webinars through the NOAA Educators Network based loosely on an online course offered by Duke called Environmental Communication for Behavior Change course http://nicholas.duke.edu/del/environmental-communication-behavior-change Network members reads the course's primary text, then review, discuss and walkthrough the book in 3 or 4 sections over a few months. The text is free and available online: http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/
 
1. Volunteers would do a "book report" webinar for a section of the book. In the preparation phase, the volunteer reads their section in depth, develop slides that summarize, highlight, and expand on the ideas of that section. Then the volunteer presents the slides on a pre-recorded webinar and shared online. We'll have meetings and provide guidelines to support this. I estimate that time commitment would be in the range of 10 to 15 hours over 2 months. 
 
2. Not exactly sure how best to facilitate the discussion element, still mulling over a few options. Have begun discussions to connect with Regional working groups to host conversations.
 
3. There would be a "final project" (similar to the Duke course), we ask interested network members to develop a plan targeted to one specific audience and aimed at changing one behavior. We'd provide a template so it's not too much burden. Another webinar would bring on a few people to present the plans they have developed. 

4. A follow up webinar in six months asks how people did so far.

I'm happy to answer any questions and we can set up a time to talk about this further.
