# NOAA Educators Network

## About the Listserv
We've set it up to provide an electronic means of sharing news and information about your education and public outreach programs, as well as to solicit feedback from your NOAA/NERRS/Sea Grant colleagues and identify potential new collaborations. We all have things to teach one another about the work we do in supporting education, so let's put this listserv to work!

## Join the Listserv
It's for communicating with other NOAA Educators across the agency and and participate in NOAA-specific PD opportunities. You will receive emails like a listserv. Anyone can post a message to the list. We like to encourage as cross-talk. For now, it's mainly being used to share info about upcoming webinars and other learning opportunities.
