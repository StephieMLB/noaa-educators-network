# NOAA Educators Network

## About

## Join the Listserv
It's for communicating with other NOAA Educators across the agency and and participate in NOAA-specific PD opportunities. You will receive emails like a listserv. Anyone can post a message to the list. We like to encourage as cross-talk. For now, it's mainly being used to share info about upcoming webinars and other learning opportunities.
