# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is it?

It’s a book club (with a twist). Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts. We’ve selected an online book called Fostering Sustainable Behaviors and it’s all about behavior change. It goes over strategies and a step-by-step approach to using social marketing as an approach for the adoption of environmentally sustainable behaviors. 

### Is this for me?

Yes. We think behavior change is an important part of many NOAA Educators’ work and is broadly applicable. You might not necessarily work in the arena of conversation and stewardship, but the same strategies also apply to adopting safety and preparedness behaviors. The same even applies to professional development and working with educators to adopt NOAA-related science and resources into their work. 

### How much time is this going to take?

We’ll walk through a module per month starting in April. For each of the four modules, there is a volunteer who has summarized their section. You will be able to watch a presentation of their summary with examples from their own program. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. We’ll also host a conference call once a month to discuss the module as a group. In total, it will take about 3 to 4 hours a month.
