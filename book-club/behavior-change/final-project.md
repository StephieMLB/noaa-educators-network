# Final Project

## Introduction


## Intructions
Describe crisply and clearly what the end result of the final project will be:

- Develop a plan for changing a behavior that is relevant to your work, OR
- Develop a case study about a project that changed behavior,
- Collaborate with a NOAA Educator in your region,

Create the final product as a Word document or PowerPoint presentation. For creative types, you might create a video or record a podcast. 

## The Process
Basically just follow the 5 steps outlined in the text. 


To accomplish the task, what steps should the learners go through? Use the numbered list format in your web editor to automatically number the steps in the procedure. Describing this section well will help other teachers to see how your lesson flows and how they might adapt it for their own use, so the more detail and care you put into this, the better. Remember that this whole document is addressed to the student, however, so describe the steps using the second person.

First you'll be assigned to a team of 3 students...
Once you've picked a role to play....
... and so on.
Learners will access the on-line resources that you've identified as they go through the Process. You may have a set of links that everyone looks at as a way of developing background information, or not. If you break learners into groups, embed the links that each group will look at within the description of that stage of the process. (Note, this is a change from the older WebQuest templates which included a separate Resources section. It's now clear that the resources belong in the Process section rather than alone.)
In the Process block, you might also provide some guidance on how to organize the information gathered. This advice could suggestions to use flowcharts, summary tables, concept maps, or other organizing structures. The advice could also take the form of a checklist of questions to analyze the information with, or things to notice or think about. If you have identified or prepared guide documents on the Web that cover specific skills needed for this lesson (e.g. how to brainstorm, how to prepare to interview an expert), link them to this section.

## Introduction
> Write a short paragraph here summarizes your plan. What behavior are you trying to change? Why is important? What strategies have you chosen? How will you pilot this project? Use this section to provide a short advance organizer or overview. Remember that the purpose of this section is to both prepare and hook the reader. It is also in this section communicate the Big Question (Essential Question, Guiding Question) that the whole plan is centered around. 

#### Behavior
What behavior are you trying to change? Is it divisible? Is it specific?

#### Barriers and Results
What strategies have proven successful in the past? What are common barriers to the change and adoption of this behavior?

#### Strategies
Which strategies have you chosen? Why? How do you plan to implement them?

#### Pilot
What is your plan for piloting these strategies? Who will you work with? What data will you collect?

#### Implementation
What is scope of full-scale implementation of your project, scaling up from the pilot? How will you scale up? What barriers do you expect to encounter?
