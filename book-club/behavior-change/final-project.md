# Plan Template

## Introduction
> Write a short paragraph here summarizes your plan. What behavior are you trying to change? Why is important? What strategies have you chosen? How will you pilot this project? Use this section to provide a short advance organizer or overview. Remember that the purpose of this section is to both prepare and hook the reader.

#### Barriers and Results
What strategies have proven successful in the past? What are common barriers to the change and adoption of this behavior?

#### Strategies
Which strategies have you chosen? Why? How do you plan to implement them?

#### Pilot
What is your plan for piloting these strategies? Who will you work with? What data will you collect?

#### Implementation
What is scope of full-scale implementation of your project, scaling up from the pilot? How will you scale up? What barriers do you expect to encounter?
