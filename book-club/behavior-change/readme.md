# About Behavior Change Book Club

## Project Description
As part of the next phase of the NOAA Educators Network webinar series, we're working on a series about Fostering Behavior Change. Capacity-building webinars through the NOAA Educators Network based loosely on an online course offered by Duke called [Environmental Communication for Behavior Change course]  (http://nicholas.duke.edu/del/environmental-communication-behavior-change) Network members reads the course's primary text, then review, discuss and walkthrough the book in 3 or 4 sections over a few months. The text is free and available online: (http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/)

Not exactly sure how best to facilitate the discussion element, still mulling over a few options. Have begun discussions to connect with Regional working groups to host conversations.

There would be a "final project" (similar to the Duke course), we ask interested network members to develop a plan targeted to one specific audience and aimed at changing one behavior. We'd provide a template so it's not too much burden. Another webinar would bring on a few people to present the plans they have developed.

A follow up webinar in six months asks how people did so far.
