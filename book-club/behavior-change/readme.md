# About Behavior Change Book Club

## Project Description
As part of the next phase of the NOAA Educators Network webinar series, we're working on a series about Fostering Behavior Change. Capacity-building webinars through the NOAA Educators Network based loosely on an online course offered by Duke called [Environmental Communication for Behavior Change course]  (http://nicholas.duke.edu/del/environmental-communication-behavior-change) Network members reads the course's primary text, then review, discuss and walkthrough the book in 3 or 4 sections over a few months. The text is free and available online: (http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/)

Not exactly sure how best to facilitate the discussion element, still mulling over a few options. Have begun discussions to connect with Regional working groups to host conversations.

There would be a "final project" (similar to the Duke course), we ask interested network members to develop a plan targeted to one specific audience and aimed at changing one behavior. We'd provide a template so it's not too much burden. Another webinar would bring on a few people to present the plans they have developed.

A follow up webinar in six months asks how people did so far.

## Frequently Asked Questions

What is it?

It’s a book club (with a twist). Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts. We’ve selected an online book called Fostering Sustainable Behaviors and it’s all about behavior change. It goes over strategies and a step-by-step approach to using social marketing as an approach for the adoption of environmentally sustainable behaviors. 

Is this for me?

Yes. We think behavior change is an important part of many NOAA Educators’ work and is broadly applicable. You might not necessarily work in the arena of conversation and stewardship, but the same strategies also apply to adopting safety and preparedness behaviors. The same even applies to professional development and working with educators to adopt NOAA-related science and resources into their work. 

How much time is this going to take?

We’ll walk through a module per month starting in April. For each of the four modules, there is a volunteer who has summarized their section. You will be able to watch a presentation of their summary with examples from their own program. We’ll also host a conference call once a month to discuss the module as a group. In total, it will take about 3 to 4 hours a month.

## Bibliography

Fostering Sustainable Behavior: Community-based Social Marketing. http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/
> This book provides a comprehensive introduction to community-based social marketing and how it is being applied throughout the world to foster sustainable behavior. It introduces the five steps of community-based social marketing (selecting behaviors, identifying barriers and benefits, developing strategies, conducting a pilot, and broad-scale implementation), and showcases numerous programs illustrating its use.

World Development Report 2015: Mind, Society, and Behavior. http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2015
> This report aims to inspire and guide the researchers and practitioners who can help advance a new set of development approaches based on a fuller consideration of psychological and social influences. The title of this Report, Mind, Society, and Behavior, captures the idea that paying attention to how humans think (the processes of mind) and how history and context shape thinking (the influence of society) can improve the design and implementation of development policies and interventions that target human choice and action (behavior).
