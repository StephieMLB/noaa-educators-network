# Behavior Change Book Club

## Description
This book club guides NOAA Educators through a practical introduction to the strategies, methods, and tools of environmental communication that effectively lead to changes in behavior, primarily using social marketing. The knowledge gained through the book club's readings, presentations and discussions will benefit all practicing outreach and education professionals faced with the challenge of changing behaviors.

Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts (modules). We’ve selected the online book called Fostering Sustainable Behaviors. We’ll walk through a module every two weeks starting in April, so the book club will run for about two months. It will be entirely online, in a distance learning format, with both asynchronous and synchronous portions. You will be able to watch a presentation of each section summarized with examples from NOAA programs. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. We’ll also host a conference call for each module as an opportunity for you to discuss ideas with your peers. In total, it will take about 6 to 8 hours a month.

 ## Technical Requirements
 We understand that participants have different comfort levels with online learning coming into this course.  We are happy to answer any questions you have about online learning in general and our online learning software.

Internet Access
Course participants need to arrange to have reliable internet access through their local internet service provider (ISP).  We encourage participants to arrange for broadband access to the internet via a cable modem, DSL, or a satellite connection.  Dial-up connections will not work as effectively for this course.  We cannot provide support for your network connection, nor can we help you with any home networking equipment such as firewalls, routers, or switches.  For any of those issues, you will want to contact your ISP directly.

As part of the next phase of the NOAA Educators Network webinar series, we're working on a series about Fostering Behavior Change. Capacity-building webinars through the NOAA Educators Network based loosely on an online course offered by Duke called [Environmental Communication for Behavior Change course]  (http://nicholas.duke.edu/del/environmental-communication-behavior-change) Network members reads the course's primary text, then review, discuss and walkthrough the book in 3 or 4 sections over a few months. The text is free and available online: (http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/)

Not exactly sure how best to facilitate the discussion element, still mulling over a few options. Have begun discussions to connect with Regional working groups to host conversations.

There would be a "final project" (similar to the Duke course), we ask interested network members to develop a plan targeted to one specific audience and aimed at changing one behavior. We'd provide a template so it's not too much burden. Another webinar would bring on a few people to present the plans they have developed.

A follow up webinar in six months asks how people did so far.
