# About Behavior Change Book Club

## Description
This book club guides NOAA Educators through a practical introduction to the strategies, methods, and tools of environmental communication that effectively lead to changes in behavior, primarily using social marketing. The knowledge gained through the book club's readings, presentations and discussions will benefit all practicing outreach and education professionals faced with the challenge of changing behaviors.

Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts. We’ve selected the online book called Fostering Sustainable Behaviors. This book club will run for about two months is entirely online, in a distance learning format, with both asynchronous and synchronous portions. We’ll walk through a module every two weeks starting in April. You will be able to watch a presentation of each section summarized with examples from NOAA programs. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. We’ll also host a conference call for each module as an opportunity for you to discuss ideas with your peers. In total, it will take about 6 to 8 hours a month.

 


As part of the next phase of the NOAA Educators Network webinar series, we're working on a series about Fostering Behavior Change. Capacity-building webinars through the NOAA Educators Network based loosely on an online course offered by Duke called [Environmental Communication for Behavior Change course]  (http://nicholas.duke.edu/del/environmental-communication-behavior-change) Network members reads the course's primary text, then review, discuss and walkthrough the book in 3 or 4 sections over a few months. The text is free and available online: (http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/preface/)

Not exactly sure how best to facilitate the discussion element, still mulling over a few options. Have begun discussions to connect with Regional working groups to host conversations.

There would be a "final project" (similar to the Duke course), we ask interested network members to develop a plan targeted to one specific audience and aimed at changing one behavior. We'd provide a template so it's not too much burden. Another webinar would bring on a few people to present the plans they have developed.

A follow up webinar in six months asks how people did so far.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is it?

It’s a book club (with a twist). Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts. We’ve selected an online book called Fostering Sustainable Behaviors and it’s all about behavior change. It goes over strategies and a step-by-step approach to using social marketing as an approach for the adoption of environmentally sustainable behaviors. 

#### Is this for me?

Yes. We think behavior change is an important part of many NOAA Educators’ work and is broadly applicable. You might not necessarily work in the arena of conversation and stewardship, but the same strategies also apply to adopting safety and preparedness behaviors. The same even applies to professional development and working with educators to adopt NOAA-related science and resources into their work. 

#### How much time is this going to take?

We’ll walk through a module per month starting in April. For each of the four modules, there is a volunteer who has summarized their section. You will be able to watch a presentation of their summary with examples from their own program. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. We’ll also host a conference call once a month to discuss the module as a group. In total, it will take about 3 to 4 hours a month.
