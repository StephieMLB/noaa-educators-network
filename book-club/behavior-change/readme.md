# Behavior Change Book Club

## Description
This book club guides NOAA Educators through a practical introduction to the strategies, methods, and tools of environmental communication that effectively lead to changes in behavior, primarily using social marketing. The knowledge gained through the book club's readings, presentations and discussions will benefit all practicing outreach and education professionals faced with the challenge of changing behaviors.

Instead of reading a book a month, we’ve taken one book and broken it up into four parts plus a final project. We’ve selected the free online book, [Fostering Sustainable Behaviors][1]. It will be entirely online, in a distance learning format, with both asynchronous and synchronous portions. 

## Details
The book club activities will take about 6 to 8 hours a month.  Time will include:
- We’ll go through a module every two weeks starting in April, so the book club will run for about three months.
- You will be able to watch a presentation of each section summarized with examples from NOAA programs. It will be pre-recorded so you will be able to watch at your convenience. 
- We’ll also host a conference call for each module as an opportunity for you to discuss ideas with your peers.
- The last module will be a final project. 
> This final project is a practical application of lessons from the book, translating what you learn into a usable strategy for yourself and your program. The project must address a real problem and real barriers and be able to be implemented within the reasonable set of resources of the players for whom you propose the strategy. The project can be plan for activities in the future or a case study of a project that has already occurred.
