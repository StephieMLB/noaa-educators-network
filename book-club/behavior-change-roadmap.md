## Volunteer Instructions
Volunteers would do a "book report" webinar for a section of the book. In the preparation phase, the volunteer reads their section in depth, develop slides that summarize, highlight, and expand on the ideas of that section. Then the volunteer presents the slides on a pre-recorded webinar and shared online. We'll have meetings and provide guidelines to support this. I estimate that time commitment would be in the range of 10 to 15 hours over 2 months.
